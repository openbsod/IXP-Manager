    <h3>Facilities</h3>
    <p>
        Facilities in IXP Manager are data centres / points of presence. A facility is somewhere that contains your racks. Racks in turn contain switches.

        <em>In previous versions of IXP Manager, facilities were referred to as locations and the backend schema still uses this older terminology.</em>
